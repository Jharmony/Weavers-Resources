> ## PermaHacks 2024 Partner's Bounties ##
 
> ## [WeaveVM](https://www.wvm.dev/) Bounties - Total Prize Pool of $6000 USD ##
> 
> **What is WeaveVM?**
> 
> [WeaveVM](https://www.wvm.dev/) is the first EVM-compatible chain to unlock Arweave’s potential for extremely low-cost onchain storage. Smart contracts on WeaveVM inherit the ability to [read and write to Arweave natively](https://blog.wvm.dev/weavevm-arweave-precompiles/), meaning Arweave can be used as a cheap and infinitely scalable data store for EVM dApps.
> 
>This unlocks content-heavy and data-intensive apps on the EVM with the permanent storage guarantees of Arweave.
>
> ### Bounty #1 On-Chain TikTok $3000 USD ###
>**Bounty Description:**
>
> Build a short video sharing dApp that uses WeaveVM’s Arweave precompile to read and write from permanent storage at the smart contract level. Integrate social features such as likes and comments. Bonus points for building a market and economy around tokenized video, and enabling token-gated content access.
> 
> ### Bounty #2 Arweave-first ERC721 factory $1000 USD ###
> **Bounty Description:**
>
>Build a contract and minting UI for ERC721 NFTs that incorporates WeaveVM’s Arweave precompiles at the contract level. Instead of uploading assets and metadata separately and cross-referencing them with the contract, a WeaveVM ERC721 could bake the whole process into one onchain transaction. Integrate the contract with a simple UI to enable non-technical users to mint NFTs and set traits.
> 
> ### Bounty #3 Data Stream Archiver $1000 USD
> **Bounty Description:**
> 
>Build a way to push web2/web3 data streams to WeaveVM so that they can be queried from inside smart contracts using the Arweave precompile. The archiver can be purpose built for anything from realtime social data to IoT device readings. The proof of concept must show how archived data can be retrieved from inside WeaveVM smart contracts.

# Deploying on Arweave: Build on the Decentralized Web #
Are you new to deploying on Arweave? Don't worry! We're here to show you just how straightforward it can be. Whether you're experienced with web development or just starting out, deploying on Arweave is as easy as pie. Here's what you need to know:

## Not Familiar with Deploying on Arweave? No Problem! ##

If you've never deployed on Arweave before, we've got your back. Join us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/gvZTg53zuJ) for more resources and help from our amazing community. Whether you have questions or need hands-on assistance, we're here to help you deploy your projects on Arweave smoothly.

## Quick Start with NextJS / ArDrive Turbo##

1. **Run create-next-app** Start by building a scafolded nextjs app to work from.

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:** Now we need to install the tools needed for us to interact with Arweave. We will leverage the ArDrive TURBO SDK for this using npm or yarn.

   ```bash
   npm install @ardrive/turbo-sdk
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn add @ardrive/turbo-sdk
   ```

3. **Create the script to interact with Arweave** Begin by loading your JWK keyfile for authentication or providing your own signer. Retrieve and display your current Arweave balance to ensure sufficient funds. Define the necessary variables for file upload and calculate the upload cost using TURBO. Compare your TURBO balance with the estimated upload cost to ensure you have enough funds. If necessary, implement a top-up window for additional balance. Finally, upload your file to Arweave, completing the process smoothly and efficiently. 

   ```javascript
   import { TurboFactory, ArweaveSigner } from '@ardrive/turbo-sdk';

   // Authenticating with a JWK
   const myKeyFile = fs.readFileSync('./my-secret-key.json');
   const myWalletAddress = arweave.wallets.jwkToAddress(myKeyFile);
   const turboClient = TurboFactory.authenticated({ privateKey: myKeyFile });
   
   // Alternatively, providing a signer
   const mySigner = new ArweaveSigner(myKeyFile);
   const turboClient = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer: mySigner });
   
   // Retrieving wallet balance
   const { winc: myBalance } = await turboClient.getBalance();
   
   // Preparing file for upload
   const myFilePath = path.join(__dirname, './my-photo.png');
   const myFileSize = fs.statSync(myFilePath).size;
   
   // Estimating upload cost
   const [{ winc: myUploadCost }] = await turboClient.getUploadCosts({
     bytes: [myFileSize],
   });
   
   // Checking balance before upload
   if (myBalance < myUploadCost) {
     const { url } = await turboClient.createCheckoutSession({
       amount: myUploadCost,
       owner: myWalletAddress,
     });
     open(url); // Prompt user to top-up balance
     return;
   }
   
   // Uploading the file
   try {
     const { id, owner, dataCaches, fastFinalityIndexes } = await turboClient.uploadFile   (() => {
       fileStreamFactory => () => fs.createReadStream(myFilePath),
       fileSizeFactory => () => myFileSize,
     });
     // File uploaded successfully
     console.log('Data item uploaded successfully!', { id, owner, dataCaches,    fastFinalityIndexes });
   } catch (error) {
     // Error handling
     console.error('Failed to upload data item!', error);
   } finally {
     // Checking new balance after upload
     const { winc: myNewBalance } = await turboClient.getBalance();
     console.log('New balance:', myNewBalance);
   }
   ```
Read the ArDrive [Turbo SDK](https://docs.ardrive.io/) docs for more details. 

## Other NPM Packages: ##

For more sophisticated interactions and additional functionalities, consider using advanced tools like **@permaweb/aoconnect** and **@ardriveapp/turbo-sdk**. These libraries provide additional features for interacting with the Arweave network, giving you more options and flexibility in your development workflow.

**Turbo SDK:**

```bash
npm install @ardrive/turbo-sdk
```

Here's a quick example of how to use the Turbo SDK to upload a file to Arweave:

```javascript
import { TurboFactory } from '@ardrive/turbo-sdk';

const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ privateKey: walletPrivateKey });

const filePath = 'path/to/your/file';
const fileSize = fs.statSync(filePath).size;

const uploadResponse = await turbo.uploadFile({
  fileStreamFactory: () => fs.createReadStream(filePath),
  fileSizeFactory: () => fileSize,
});

console.log('Upload complete:', uploadResponse);
```

For more in-depth walkthroughs and tutorials, we highly recommend checking out our previous hackathon sessions:

**AoConnect:**

```bash
npm install --save @permaweb/aoconnect
```

Here's a quick example of how to use AoConnect to send a message on the Arweave network:

```javascript
import { message, createDataItemSigner } from "@permaweb/aoconnect";

const wallet = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('path/to/wallet.json'));

await message({
    process: "process-id",
    tags: [
        { name: "Your-Tag-Name-Here", value: "your-tag-value" },
        { name: "Another-Tag", value: "another-value" },
    ],
    signer: createDataItemSigner(wallet),
    data: "any data",
})
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.error);
```

## To the metal with Arweave.js ##

1. **Install Arweave.js:** Start by installing Arweave.js, a JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for interacting with the Arweave network. This SDK allows you to easily connect your projects to Arweave, enabling decentralized storage and permanent hosting.

   ```bash
   npm install --save arweave
   ```

2. **Initialize Arweave:** Once you've installed Arweave.js, it's time to initialize it. This step sets up Arweave to connect to a gateway, which acts as your entry point to the Arweave network. Don't worry; it's just a few lines of code!

   ```javascript
   const Arweave = require('arweave');

   const arweave = Arweave.init({
       host: 'arweave.net', // Or other node
       port: 443,           // HTTPS port
       protocol: 'https'    // Local development
   });
   ```

3. **Create and Sign Transactions:** With Arweave.js initialized, you can start creating and signing transactions to store your project data on the Arweave network. These transactions can include HTML, JSON, or any other type of data you want to store permanently.

   ```javascript
   const myWallet = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('path/to/wallet.json'));

   const myTransaction = await arweave.createTransaction({
     data: 'Welcome to Berlin!',
   }, myWallet);
   
   myTransaction.addTag('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
   
   await arweave.transactions.sign(myTransaction, myWallet);
   
   const myResponse = await arweave.transactions.post(myTransaction);
   console.log(myResponse.status);
   ```

## AO Documentation ##

[ao Atomic Asset Implementation](https://github.com/permaweb/ao-atomic-asset) - Atomic assets are unique digital items stored on Arweave, where both the asset data and the AO-based process (instead of the traditional SmartWeave) are uploaded in a single, inseparable transaction.

[ao SPEC](https://ao.arweave.dev/#/spec) - The ao computer is a single, unified computing environment (a Single System Image), hosted on a heterogenous set of nodes in a distributed network. 

[ao Official Repo](https://github.com/permaweb/ao) - The ao computer is the actor oriented machine that emerges from the network of nodes that adhere to its core data protocol, running on the Arweave network.

[ao Cookbook](https://ao.g8way.io/) - The ao computer is a world where countless parallel processes interact within a single, cohesive computing environment, seamlessly interlinked through a native message-passing layer.

[ao Module](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/references/ao.html) - ao process communication is handled by messages, each process receives messages in the form of ANS-104 DataItems, and needs to be able to do the following common operations.

[Get Started in 5 Min](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/welcome/getting-started.html) - Get ao up and running in your local dev enviorment in under 5 minutes. 

[ao Tutorials](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/tutorials/begin/index.html) - tutorials that will walk you through an interactive set of steps that will help you deepen your knowledge and understanding of the aos environment.

[aos Introduction](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aos/intro.html) - aos is a different approach to building Processes or Contracts, the ao computer is a decentralized computer network that allows compute to run anywhere and aos in a unique interactive shell.

[Accessing Data from Arweave with ao](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/references/data.html) - In order, to request data from arweave, you simply call Assign with a list of processes you would like to assign the data to, and a Message which is the txid of a Message.

[.load in ao process](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aos/load.html) - This feature allows you to load lua code from a source file on your local machine, this simple feature gives you a nice DX experience for working with aos processes.

[Connecting to specific ao nodes](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aos/load.html) - When including ao connect in your code you have the ability to connect to a specific MU and CU, as well as being able to specifiy an Arweave gateway. 

[Sending a Message to a Process](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aoconnect/sending-messages.html) - Sending a message is the central way in which your app can interact with ao. A message is input to a process.

[Reading results from an ao Process](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aoconnect/reading-results.html) - A call to results can also provide you paginated list of multiple results.

[Spawning a Process](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aoconnect/spawning-processes.html) - In order to spawn a Process you must have the TXID of an ao Module that has been uploaded to Arweave.

[Calling DryRun](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aoconnect/calling-dryrun.html) - DryRun is the process of sending a message object to a specific process and getting the Result object back, but the memory is not saved, it is perfect to create a read message to return the current value of memory.

[Monitoring Cron](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aoconnect/monitoring-cron.html) - Setting cron tags means that your process will start producing cron results in its outbox, but you need to monitor these results if you want messages from those results to be pushed through the network.

[Sending an Assignment to a Process](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aoconnect/assign-data.html) - Assignments can be used to load Data from another Message into a Process. Or to not duplicate Messages.

[Core ao Concepts](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/concepts/index.html) -ao has a couple of core concepts built into the design.
